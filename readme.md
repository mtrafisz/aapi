# AAPI - Anime API

Simple C# REST API for managing list of animes and images associated with them.

My goal is recreating something resembling [MAL](https://myanimelist.net).

## Todo

- [x] User management
- [x] List of anime entries for users
- [ ] Image management is a mess
- [ ] Some kind of front-end
- [ ] Check out github workflows and docker - I'm not sure if this will even run on anything besides my PC.
- [ ] Better documentation?
